This is the release exe for my homework 1 submission.

Run s3dtool.exe from command prompt and pass the name of the s3d file as an argument (included toast.s3d in this folder as a sample).

If the s3d file is in another folder, the full filepath can be entered.

A new version of the file will be created in its folder with the name <filename>new.s3d with the processed vertices.
